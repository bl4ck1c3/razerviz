This is my attempt to create a Winamp visualization that works with
the Razer Deathstriker Ultimate keyboard.

It's based upon the [Tiny3D Winamp visualization](tiny3d) framework and 
is in a state where it is rather... unstable. The project renders
the graphic equalizer to the keyboard screen and has hooks for using
media keys to control Winamp.
